    "summary": "Queensland has refused to give up on its decade-long dynasty with a stirring 18-16 comeback win over New South Wales in Origin II in Sydney.",
    "content": "The victory had all the hallmarks of a classic Maroons fightback, with Dane Gagai scoring a thrilling late try and Johnathan Thurston converting under pressure to secure the two-point win.Gagai's try was his second of the night and seventh in six Origin appearances. It capped another near-flawless performance in attack and defence from the zippy winger.The match-winner was the result of a brilliant Michael Morgan flick pass from low to the ground in the 78th minute after a desperate attack went through the hands of Thurston and Billy Slater. Just like fellow great Thurston who was also returning to the Origin fray, Slater's presence proved critical in the latter stages of the game; he was calm in defence and typically spritely as Queensland attacked the line.Thurston appeared to be struggling with his suspect shoulder for much of the second half, but NSW could not exploit the wounded Queensland legend's weakness. Kevin Walters' side had looked down-and-out at the half-time break, trailing 16-6 against a rampant Blues who were dominating going forward and through the backline.With so much on the line, there was a risk the players could produce a dour affair, but it was soon clear that was not happening, as both sides wrestled for the attacking advantage. In the opening exchanges, Aaron Woods crunched Holmes with a head-on car-crash of a tackle and Hayne showed his defensive prowess by sweeping Will Chambers into touch after a slick Maroons move, but it was the Queenslanders who scored first.They took their first lead of the series when Thurston, Slater and Darius Boyd spread the ball wide before Holmes flirted with the touchline and dived over in the corner for the opening try.If they thought the momentum of the series had changed they were in for a rude shock, as the Blues blasted back with three blistering tries.They stormed down the right edge with a couple of big runs then moved the ball fast enough through the hands for Hayne to find enough space to cruise over in the left corner. Maloney matched Thurston's earlier effort to convert from the sideline and make it 6-6.Morris struck next, feasting off the space created when Maloney went around Tim Glasby to score in the corner.NSW again found joy through the middle, with the powerful Jake Trbojevic passing inside to an accelerating Tedesco, who burst into space before feeding Pearce for a third try and a 16-6 lead. They held that lead to the end of a half which they completely dominated, with Trbojevic and Josh Jackson the standout players in the Blues' engine room.There were no indications early in the second half that Queensland would turn the game around, as whatever they tried in attack the Blues had an answer for with their organised and ferocious defence.The Maroons persisted, though, and found the line through the irrepressible Gagai with just under 30 minutes left to play.Josh McGuire deserved much of the credit for busting a tackle and surging forward before offloading to Cooper Cronk. The half-back found Chambers who moved it along with a superb around-the-corner pass to Gagai, who went over for his sixth try in as many Origin appearances. Thurston converted to bring the Maroons within four points at 16-12 and set up the memorable finale.It sets up a decider at Lang Park, which will be Thurston's final Origin game and could well spell the end for Cronk, who is yet to sign with a club after announcing a move to Sydney in 2018.

    "summary": "Queen Elizabeth II has outlined the UK Government's legislative program in a speech to Parliament, after the Prime Minister slimmed down her plans and promised \"humility\" in negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union.",
    "content": " The Queen carried on with her royal duties at the ceremonial opening of the new Parliament despite the announcement that her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, had been hospitalised.Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip, 96, was admitted to hospital as a precaution, for treatment of an infection.His rare absence from the state opening of Parliament added to the solemnity of an occasion cherished by many British people and replete with historical tradition.While the Queen reads the Queen's speech to politicians, it is written by the Prime Minister and her staff and offers a broad brush of goals for the future.Eight of 27 bills outlined in the speech deal with the complex process of Brexit.It is also notable that Theresa May omitted several controversial policies touted in the Conservative election campaign, including plans to change funding for the care of older people, which opponents dubbed the \"dementia tax\".There was also no mention of US President Donald Trump's invitation for a state visit, which sparked criticism from all parties. Ms May called a snap election expecting an overwhelming victory that would silence dissenters and give her a mandate to push ahead with plans to leave the European Union and drastically limit immigration.Instead, she lost seats and still has not secured a deal with another party to ensure Parliament will back the Government's agenda.\"The election result was not the one I hoped for, but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent,\" Ms May said in a statement.\"We will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the British people, making their priorities our priorities.\"Normally the Queen's speech repeats key legislative promises made during the election campaign, but many voters rejected the Prime Minister's plans for a so-called hard Brexit and other controversial policies.Signalling the importance of Brexit negotiations with the EU, which will last until the spring of 2019, the speech set out the Government's program for two years, rather than one.The Prime Minister, who had campaigned with the slogan \"Brexit means Brexit\", softened her tone in comments released ahead of the speech.\"First, we need to get Brexit right,\" she said.\"That means getting a deal which delivers the result of last year's referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support.\"Even before news of Prince Philip's illness, the Government had announced that the speech would be delivered with less pageantry than normal as a result of the timing of the snap election.For instance, the Queen arrived at Parliament in a car, rather than a horse-drawn carriage, and delivered the speech in everyday dress, instead of the traditional royal robes.The primary issue was scheduling, with the state opening taking place only days after another huge annual event, Trooping the Colour, a celebration of the Queen's birthday.Both ceremonies take weeks of preparation and planning and officials deemed it too difficult to prepare for two such events so close together.

    "content": "The Queensland senator made the suggestion during debate on the Federal Government's school funding legislation, saying children with disabilities were putting a strain on teachers and schools and should be educated separately.\"These kids have a right to an education, by all means, but, if there are a number of them, these children should go into a special classroom and be looked after and given that special attention,\" she told the chamber.\"Because most of the time the teacher spends so much time on them they forget about the child who is straining at the bit and wants to go ahead in leaps and bounds in their education.\"Both Labor and the Greens have condemned Senator Hanson's remarks while disability advocates, including Craig Wallace, said there was no evidence to support her claims.\"What the evidence does tell us is that students with a disability perform much worse when they are put away in segregated settings and denied the benefits of a mainstream face-to-face education,\" he said. Mr Wallace speaks from personal experience.He was sent to a so-called special school, which he said was like a warehouse where children with disabilities were \"shunted away\" and given a cheap education.\"It is segregation, it is a kind of apartheid and it's one that many of us experienced personally,\" he said.\"It simply doesn't work, it's second rate and no-one benefits by people with disabilities being excluded.\"His comments were echoed by Autism Australia chief executive Nicole Rogerson, whose 21-year-old son Jack has autism. She said she felt sick when she heard Senator Hanson's \"repulsive, bigoted and hurtful\" comments and argued they took \"the discussion about inclusive education back about 50 years\".\"Any Australian still listening to that woman needs to seriously think about what they're doing,\" she said.Ms Rogerson said Senator Hanson would do well to realise there were 160,000 Australians with autism and accused her of turning her back on the \"battlers\" she claimed to represent.\"They vote and their parents vote and their grandparents vote and they will not be voting for her,\" she said.\"If she cares about the battlers, she needs to know that those battlers have got kids with autism and they're struggling.\"Greens senator Rachel Siewert called on Senator Hanson to apologise and retract her comments, which she said showed \"a lack of understanding of the issues and the fact that people have been working so strongly to ensure we have an inclusive community\".",

    "content": "BEIJING (AP) — Beer-soaked \"booze cruises\" down North Korea's Taedong River. Scuba diving trips off the country's eastern coast. Saint Patrick's Day pub crawls in Pyongyang featuring drinking games with cheery locals.Since 2008, the Young Pioneer Tours agency built up a business attracting young travelers with a competitively priced catalog of exotic-sounding, hard-partying adventures in one of the world's most isolated countries.But the death last week of 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier, who was arrested during a Young Pioneer tour to North Korea in late 2015 and fell into a coma in prison, has renewed questions about whether the company was adequately prepared for its trips into the hard-line communist state.Although many details of Warmbier's fateful trip remain unknown, interviews with past Young Pioneer customers or those who have crossed paths with the tour operator describe a company with occasional lapses in organization, a gung-ho drinking culture and a cavalier attitude that has long raised red flags among industry peers and North Korea watchers.Founded in 2008 by Briton Gareth Johnson in the central Chinese city of Xi'an, Young Pioneer's fun and casual style was seen precisely as its calling card, a counterpoint to North Korea's reputation as an inaccessible, draconian hermit kingdom. \"Budget tours to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from,\" its website touts, while describing North Korea as one of the safest places on Earth.But in travel circles in Beijing, the staging point for trips into North Korea, Young Pioneer Tours, also known as YPT, has been associated with a string of cautionary tales, including of the tourist who performed a handstand outside the most politically sensitive mausoleum in Pyongyang where two generations of the Kim family are buried, resulting in a North Korean guide losing her job. During another tour, Johnson attempted to step off a moving train after drinking and broke his ankle, leading to an unexpected stay at a Pyongyang hospital.Adam Pitt, a 33-year old British expatriate who formerly lived in Beijing and went on a 2013 trip, described to the AP a party atmosphere led by Johnson, who was often heavily inebriated and \"almost unable to stand and barely understandable when he did speak\" at a tense border crossing where he needed to hand wads of cash to officials as bribes.While it's expected for tourists to relax and enjoy a few drinks while traveling, tour operators and tourists say YPT has long stood out for its party-hearty tour groups. In respective interviews with Fairfax Media and the Independent newspaper, Nick Calder, a New Zealander, and Darragh O Tuathail, an Irish tourist, both recalled the YPT group Warmbier traveled with carousing until early morning. O Tuathail declined to discuss his recollections of the trip with the AP, saying he wanted to let Warmbier's family grieve in peace.In an emotional news conference last week, Fred Warmbier, Otto's father, lashed out at tour agencies that \"advertise slick ads on the internet proclaiming, 'No American ever gets detained on our tours' and 'This is a safe place to go.'\"Earlier this week, YPT issued a statement saying it would no longer accept American customers because \"the assessment of risk for Americans visiting North Korea has become too high.\"Pitt, who is Mormon and does not drink, said the company's statement appeared to shift blame onto tourists rather than examining its own laissez-faire culture.\"It's not about who goes, it's about how their groups behave that causes problems,\" said Pitt.YPT co-owner Rowan Beard said most reviewers have attested to the company's professionalism and preparation.\"Frankly everyone has different perceptions on things like drinking and what concerns it raises,\" Beard wrote in an email. \"With the recent tragedy it's human nature for some people to over-emphasize certain aspects of their experience.\"Beard noted that the mausoleum incident did not involve alcohol and that YPT had warned all customers about the political sensitivities of the site.He added that YPT has taken over 8,000 tourists to North Korea with only one incident, and boasts a 5-star rating and certificate of excellence on the TripAdvisor review website. Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Beard said Johnson was unavailable to comment and no longer leads tours. He said Johnson was in North Korea on business when Warmbier was detained but was not part of his tour.John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, said tour groups barely existed 10 years ago, and any sliver of \"responsible engagement\" between the U.S. and North Korea is valuable. But he worried about tours that do not educate customers on the nuances and political realities of what they're seeing.\"Hipster adventure tourism, where it's like going to a zoo and staring at North Koreans, is problematic,\" said Delury, who is familiar with several of the companies running tours into North Korea. \"It seems like the framing of Warmbier's trip was 'go party and have a good time in Pyongyang.' That is obviously not how responsible tour companies would frame what they're about.\"YPT has in recent years expanded its North Korea tours and boasts a long list of other so-called \"dark tourism\" offerings, ranging from trips to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site in Ukraine to jaunts through Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region.Christopher Barbara, a legal consultant who splits his time between Montreal and Shanghai, said he joined a YPT trip to North Korea in 2009 headed by Johnson.\"It was so laid back that it was hard to take seriously,\" Barbara said. \"The way Young Pioneers managed the trip made it feel like the priority was having fun, not staying safe. I'm not sure it was the right balance, all things considered.\"One morning after they arrived, Barbara told the group's North Korean minders who were looking for Johnson that he was ill, when he was in fact asleep after a long night.\"I was worried that Gareth's behavior was going to get us in trouble,\" Barbara said. \"At times, I felt pressured to cover for him.\"Questionable behavior has cropped up more recently, including on the New Year's Party tour of Pyongyang in late December 2015 that coincided with the tour that Warmbier was part of.In an anonymous January 2016 review left on TripAdvisor, a woman who took a train back to China said a YPT guide pulled a prank by helping hide her husband's passport from border agents. That resulted in a scramble to find the passport and a confrontation with irked North Korean soldiers who briefly held her husband.Troy Collings, a partner at the tour company, responded to the review on TripAdvisor and apologized, saying that the guide who participated in the prank had been removed from tours and would undergo \"retraining.\"\"We as company in no way condone any behavior that makes our customers feel unsafe, in danger, or that our guide lacked empathy with you,\" Collings wrote. \"Whilst we feel there may have been some misunderstandings it does not excuse what happened.\"___Follow Gerry Shih on Twitter at twitter.com/gerryshih",

The Palestinians claim these territories for their future independent state.After two decades of failed U.S.-led peace efforts, Palestinian statehood seems distant. Envoy Jason Greenblatt has already made several visits.Even before his meetings, Kushner faced a new crisis.On the eve of his arrival, Israel broke ground on a new West Bank settlement for residents of an illegally built outpost that was dismantled in February under orders from the Supreme Court.Netanyahu had vowed to compensate the residents of Amona with a new settlement, built on a nearby site in the northern West Bank.\"The people of Amona really appreciate his efforts and the efforts from his office in fulfilling this commitment that started to come alive to create this new community,\" said Avichai Boaron, a spokesman for the settlers.The move has infuriated the Palestinians, who say all settlements are illegal obstacles to peace. Trump has asked Israel to show \"restraint\" in its settlement construction.\"This is the way Netanyahu is meeting Trump's envoys,\" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian official. \"The real question here is will the administration of Trump tell Israel that it is enough and they have to stop immediately all settlement activities, or they will accept this Israeli provocation?\"Kushner did not speak to reporters ahead of his talks Wednesday, and Israeli security agents blocked AP cameramen from filming the arrival of his convoy. In one case, a cameraman was ordered to leave a sidewalk outside the government compound that houses Netanyahu's office, and in other case, a cameraman was ordered to delete his memory card of all images of the prime minister's office.Once on the ground, Kushner immediately paid a condolence visit to the family of a young female Israeli police officer who was killed by Palestinian attackers over the weekend near Jerusalem's Old City. Kushner said Trump asked him to personally convey the condolences of the American people.Three Palestinian attackers armed with an automatic weapon and knives assaulted officers on duty near the Old City in two locations on Friday evening.Police said Staff Sgt. Maj. Hadas Malka, 23, was rushing to respond to the initial attack nearby when a Palestinian assaulted her with a knife. Malka wrestled with the man for several seconds as he stabbed her multiple times before other officers saw what was happening and opened fire, killing him, police said. She later died of her wounds in hospital.Thousands attended her funeral Saturday night. Netanyahu visited her grieving family on Sunday and called Malka \"everybody's daughter and everybody's hero.\" He also criticized Abbas for not condemning the attack.It was the latest incident in a wave of Palestinian attacks that began in September 2015. Since then, Palestinian assailants have killed 43 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British student, mainly in stabbing attacks. Some 250 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire during the same period, most of them identified as attackers by Israel.",

    "content": "Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is in fresh doubt after there was no mention of it in the Queen's Speech.The US president accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain when Prime Minister Theresa May visited Washington in January.But there have been reports that Mr Trump has changed his mind and does not want to come to the UK while there is potential for protests against him.The Queen did not mention it because no date has been set, Number 10 said.Wednesday's Queen's Speech saw the monarch announce the government's legislative programme for the next two years at the State Opening of Parliament.The monarch always also uses the speech to set out her official plans for the year.She said she looked forward to welcoming King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain for their state visit in July, and hosting the Commonwealth summit in April next year.But there was no word about Mr Trump's state visit. October had been suggested as a possible date.Brexit bills at heart of Queen's SpeechBill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Queen's Speech reflects weaker MayA Downing Street spokesman said: \"An invitation has been extended and accepted.\"The visit wasn't mentioned in the Queen's Speech because a date hasn't been fixed yet.\"In his last statement on the issue, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: \"Her Majesty extended an invitation to the president. He's accepted that invitation. And we look forward to scheduling that trip.\"There is nothing that was scheduled and we look forward to working out a mutually acceptable date with the United Kingdom, and look forward to sharing that date.\"There is a very good reason for that date not being set. That is because there are concerns within the White House that if Donald Trump came to the UK, there would be some substantial protests.There is also a concern within the British government that it would not help US-UK relations if the US president was embarrassed.It is very unlikely he will be coming this year.This government has only so much bandwidth, that trying to work out precisely when they are going to have a visit from the US president, particularly if he is having cold feet, is something I imagine they will say to put on the back burner for a bit.When the invitation was first made by Theresa May on behalf of the Queen, there was a lot of concern that she had jumped the gun and gone too fast on this - to give a new US president the offer of a full state visit was a little premature.Normally that kind of offer does not come until well into the presidency. It quite often happens in a president's second term - if re-elected - and not all US presidents get full state visits.So the fact that it is going to be delayed will not come as a huge disappointment to many people who thought it was a little bit too much, too early.",

What gives?For starters, investors are increasingly attracted to BDCs as a higher yielding alternative to junk-rated debt, and the ETF gives them access to that. BDCs are set up like closed-end investment funds that, like private equity firms, help small and medium-sized companies grow in their initial stages. They’re now taking on a greater share of commercial loans to these businesses, filling a void created by banks that are pulling back from this segment. BIZD buys shares of firms that invest in the debt and equity of these businesses.“We look at these BDCs as shadow financiers for the middle market,” said Keith Wander, portfolio manager for Roble, Belko & Co. Inc. “We look at this as a surrogate to high-yield, and with this fund you’re getting anywhere from 300 to 400 basis points in yield over high-yield mutual funds.”And then there’s the complexity of BIZD’s architecture, with multiple layers that add to its massive expense ratio.The ETF essentially is structured as a fund of funds in its BDC holdings. As such, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires its expense ratio to include any of the acquired fees from the underlying investment companies it holds, according to Meredith Larson, product manager at VanEck. These fees and expenses are “embedded in the return of the ETF,” but if the added costs are factored out VanEck calculates that investors are actually being charged about 41 basis points for the fund’s management, she said.Assets for BIZD have taken off this year, increasing by more than 40 percent to $195 million through June 21, according to Bloomberg data. Buyers poured $21 million into the ETF in May, the largest month of inflows since its inception in February 2013, the data show.The spread of BDC yields relative to more traditional junk bonds has widened this year, nearing 400 basis points compared to the 300 basis-point average, Wander said. To chase that, he replaced the high-yield exposure he was getting through VHDYX, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund, with BIZD.That said, Wander still has some concerns given the potential deregulation of banks and how this could increase competition for BDCs in the space. But the price-to-book for the S&P 500 Banks Industry Group Index has had a nice run up over the past year compared to a flat ratio for BDCs, meaning BDCs are now relatively undervalued. This could help explain the surging demand for BIZD.VanEck’s Larson doesn’t worry much about bank competition.“When I speak to analysts their opinion is that as a result of Dodd-Frank a lot of banks had to dismantle a lot of these processes where they would have had these kind of loans,” she said. “They’re not likely to take the time to re-establish that, and BDCs have become well-oiled machines.”The only other way to get BDC exposure through an exchange-traded product is the ETRACS Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index ETN, ticker BDCS. But exchange-traded notes have counter-party credit risk, which is a turnoff for investors, Larson said.In fact, David Cowles, director of investment for the San Francisco-based asset manager Mosaic Financial Partners Inc., said he moved out of the ETN and into the fund as soon as the BIZD launched.“This is a nice way for us to get a little bit of exposure to the venture capital world without running into the hedge fund and private equity kind of investments,” Cowles said. “It has very high historical returns, but also very high volatility.”",
